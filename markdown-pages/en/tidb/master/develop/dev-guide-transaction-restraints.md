# Transaction Restraints

This document briefly introduces the transaction restraints in TiDB.

## Isolation levels

The isolation levels supported by TiDB are **RC (Read Committed)** and **SI (Snapshot Isolation)**, where **SI** is basically equivalent to the **RR (Repeatable Read)** isolation level.

![isolation level](https://download.pingcap.com/images/docs/develop/transaction_isolation_level.png)

## Snapshot Isolation can avoid phantom reads

The `SI` isolation level of TiDB can avoid **Phantom Reads**, but the `RR` in ANSI/ISO SQL standard cannot.

The following two examples show what **phantom reads** is.

- Example 1: **Transaction A** first gets `n` rows according to the query, and then **Transaction B** changes `m` rows other than these `n` rows or adds `m` rows that match the query of **Transaction A**. When **Transaction A** runs the query again, it finds that there are `n+m` rows that match the condition. It is like a phantom, so it is called a **phantom read**.

- Example 2: **Admin A** changes the grades of all students in the database from specific scores to ABCDE grades, but **Admin B** inserts a record with a specific score at this time. When **Admin A** finishes changing and finds that there is still a record (the one inserted by **Admin B**) that has not been changed yet. That is a **phantom read**.

## SI cannot avoid write skew

TiDB's SI isolation level cannot avoid **write skew** exceptions. You can use the `SELECT FOR UPDATE` syntax to avoid **write skew** exceptions.

A **write skew** exception occurs when two concurrent transactions read different but related records, and then each transaction updates the data it reads and eventually commits the transaction. If there is a constraint between these related records that cannot be modified concurrently by multiple transactions, then the end result will violate the constraint.

For example, suppose you are writing a doctor shift management program for a hospital. Hospitals typically require several doctors to be on call at the same time, but the minimum requirement is that at least one doctor is on call. Doctors can drop their shifts (for example, if they are feeling sick) as long as at least one doctor is on call during that shift.

Now there is a situation where doctors `Alice` and `Bob` are on call. Both are feeling sick, so they decide to take sick leave. They happen to click the button at the same time. Let's simulate this process with the following program:


```java
package com.pingcap.txn.write.skew;

        HikariDataSource ds = new HikariDataSource();
        ds.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:4000/test?useServerPrepStmts=true&cachePrepStmts=true");
        ds.setUsername("root");

        // prepare data
        Connection connection = ds.getConnection();
        createDoctorTable(connection);
        createDoctor(connection, 1, "Alice", true, 123);
        createDoctor(connection, 2, "Bob", true, 123);
        createDoctor(connection, 3, "Carol", false, 123);

        Semaphore txn1Pass = new Semaphore(0);
        CountDownLatch countDownLatch = new CountDownLatch(2);
        ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        threadPool.execute(() -> {

        });

        threadPool.execute(() -> {
            askForLeave(ds, txn1Pass, 2, 2);
            countDownLatch.countDown();
        });

        countDownLatch.await();
    }

    public static void createDoctorTable(Connection connection) throws SQLException {
        connection.createStatement().executeUpdate("CREATE TABLE `doctors` (" +

    public static void createDoctor(Connection connection, Integer id, String name, Boolean onCall, Integer shiftID) throws SQLException {

                "INSERT INTO `doctors` (`id`, `name`, `on_call`, `shift_id`) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)");

        try(Connection connection = ds.getConnection()) {

                currentOnCallQuery.setInt(2, 123);
                ResultSet res = currentOnCallQuery.executeQuery();

                if (!res.next()) {
                    throw new RuntimeException("error query");
                } else {
                    int count = res.getInt("count");
                    if (count >= 2) {
                        // If current on-call doctor has 2 or more, this doctor can leave
                        PreparedStatement insert = connection.prepareStatement( comment +
                                "UPDATE `doctors` SET `on_call` = ? WHERE `id` = ? AND `shift_id` = ?");
                        insert.setBoolean(1, false);
                        insert.setInt(2, doctorID);
                        insert.setInt(3, 123);
                        insert.executeUpdate();

                        connection.commit();
                    } else {
                        throw new RuntimeException("At least one doctor is on call");
                    }
                }

                // Txn 2 done, let txn 1 run again
                if (txnID == 2) {
                    txn1Pass.release();
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                // If got any error, you should roll back, data is priceless
                connection.rollback();
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

SQL log:


```sql
/* txn 1 */ BEGIN
    /* txn 2 */ BEGIN
    /* txn 2 */ SELECT COUNT(*) as `count` FROM `doctors` WHERE `on_call` = 1 AND `shift_id` = 123
    /* txn 2 */ UPDATE `doctors` SET `on_call` = 0 WHERE `id` = 2 AND `shift_id` = 123
    /* txn 2 */ COMMIT
/* txn 1 */ SELECT COUNT(*) AS `count` FROM `doctors` WHERE `on_call` = 1 and `shift_id` = 123
/* txn 1 */ UPDATE `doctors` SET `on_call` = 0 WHERE `id` = 1 AND `shift_id` = 123
/* txn 1 */ COMMIT
```

Running result:


```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM doctors;
+----+-------+---------+----------+
| id | name  | on_call | shift_id |
+----+-------+---------+----------+
|  1 | Alice |       0 |      123 |
|  2 | Bob   |       0 |      123 |
|  3 | Carol |       0 |      123 |
+----+-------+---------+----------+
```

In both transactions, the application first checks if two or more doctors are on call; if so, it assumes that one doctor can safely take leave. Since the database uses the snapshot isolation, both checks return `2`, so both transactions move on to the next stage. `Alice` updates her record to be off duty, and so does `Bob`. Both transactions are successfully committed. Now there are no doctors on duty which violates the requirement that at least one doctor should be on call. The following diagram (quoted from **_Designing Data-Intensive Applications_**) illustrates what actually happens.

Now let's change the sample program to use `SELECT FOR UPDATE` to avoid the write skew problem:

        // prepare data
        Connection connection = ds.getConnection();
        createDoctorTable(connection);

```

## `savepoint` and nested transactions are not supported

TiDB does **_NOT_** support the `savepoint` mechanism and therefore does not support the `PROPAGATION_NESTED` propagation behavior. If your applications are based on the **Java Spring** framework that use the `PROPAGATION_NESTED` propagation behavior, you need to adapt it on the application side to remove the logic for nested transactions.

The `PROPAGATION_NESTED` propagation behavior supported by **Spring** triggers a nested transaction, which is a child transaction that is started independently of the current transaction. A `savepoint` is recorded when the nested transaction starts. If the nested transaction fails, the transaction will roll back to the `savepoint` state. The nested transaction is part of the outer transaction and will be committed together with the outer transaction.

The following example demonstrates the `savepoint` mechanism:


```sql
mysql> BEGIN;
mysql> INSERT INTO T2 VALUES(100);
mysql> SAVEPOINT svp1;
mysql> INSERT INTO T2 VALUES(200);
mysql> ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT svp1;
mysql> RELEASE SAVEPOINT svp1;
mysql> COMMIT;
mysql> SELECT * FROM T2;
+------+
|  ID   |
+------+
|  100 |
+------+
```

## Large transaction restrictions

The basic principle is to limit the size of the transaction. At the KV level, TiDB has a restriction on the size of a single transaction. At the SQL level, one row of data is mapped to one KV entry, and each additional index will add one KV entry. The restriction is as follows at the SQL level:

- The maximum single row record size is `120 MB`. You can configure it by `performance.txn-entry-size-limit` for TiDB v5.0 and later versions. The value is `6 MB` for earlier versions.
- The maximum single transaction size supported is `10 GB`. You can configure it by `performance.txn-total-size-limit` for TiDB v4.0 and later versions. The value is `100 MB` for earlier versions.

Note that for both the size restrictions and row restrictions, you should also consider the overhead of encoding and additional keys for the transaction during the transaction execution. To achieve optimal performance, it is recommended to write one transaction every 100 ~ 500 rows.

## Auto-committed `SELECT FOR UPDATE` statements do NOT wait for locks

Currently locks are not added to auto-committed `SELECT FOR UPDATE` statements. The effect is shown in the following figure:

![The situation in TiDB](https://download.pingcap.com/images/docs/develop/autocommit_selectforupdate_nowaitlock.png)

This is a known incompatibility issue with MySQL. You can solve this issue by using the explicit `BEGIN;COMMIT;` statements.
